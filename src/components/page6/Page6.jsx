                <h3>pH adjustment</h3>
                <p>pH adjustment is a method of solubilization used in physical pharmacy to enhance the solubility of poorly soluble drugs or compounds in a given solvent or solution system. This method involves adjusting the pH of the solution to a level where the drug molecule is more soluble.

                    The solubility of a drug can be influenced by the ionization state of its functional groups, which can be affected by the pH of the solution. For example, acidic drugs tend to be more soluble in basic pH solutions, while basic drugs tend to be more soluble in acidic pH solutions. This is because the ionization of acidic and basic functional groups of the drug changes at different pH values.

                    By adjusting the pH of the solution to a level where the drug molecule is more soluble, the solubility and bioavailability of the drug can be increased. This can be achieved by adding acidic or basic agents to the solution to change the pH value. However, it is important to note that excessive pH adjustments can also affect the stability and safety of the drug.

                    pH adjustment is a useful method of solubilization for drugs that are affected by pH changes and have functional groups that can ionize. However, the use of pH adjustment may also increase the risk of drug degradation and toxicity, and therefore, careful consideration and optimization of the formulation are necessary.
